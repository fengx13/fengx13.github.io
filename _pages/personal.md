More about me:

- My name in Chinese is 谢丰, and I was raised in Guilin, a picturesque city in Southern China renowned for its stunning landscapes, famously described as “桂林山水甲天下” (East or west, Guilin scenery is best).

- I am an outdoor enthusiast and nature explorer. Throughout my life, I have engaged in a variety of outdoor sports, including [hiking](), [climbing](), [abseiling](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/abs.jpg), [surfing](), [scuba diving](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/diving.jpg), [free diving](), [caving](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/caving.mp4), [sailing](), [kayaking](), and [cycling](). I hold an Advanced Open Water (AOW) Diver certification with over 60 dives and am also certified in dinghy sailing and sea kayaking. The three best dive sites I have been to are the Similan Islands in Thailand, Sipadan Island in Sabah, Malaysia, and Komodo National Park in Indonesia. The best caving experience I had was at Wind Cave and Clearwater Cave in Mulu National Park in Sarawak, Malaysia. I completed the 4.8-kilometer Clearwater Connection trail, spending over 8 hours underground. The journey involved climbing up and down muddy slopes, squeezing through tight passages, and repeatedly swimming across the underground river.

- My academic journey has taken me to three different countries across the world, enriching my experiences and adventures. I completed my BS degree in China, where I traveled extensively [across the country for hiking and mountaineering](https://fengx13.github.io/images/4.jpg). During my PhD in Singapore, I explored neighboring countries in tropical Southeast Asia to see [volcanoes](), [rain forests](), and the [underwater world](). In the United States, I have enjoyed visiting national parks and immersing myself in the [wilderness](https://github.com/fengx13/fengx13.github.io/blob/master/images/5.jpg).
