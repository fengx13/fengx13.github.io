## More about me

- My name in Chinese is 谢丰, and I was raised in Guilin, a picturesque city in Southern China renowned for its stunning landscapes, famously described as “桂林山水甲天下” (East or west, Guilin scenery is best).

- I am an outdoor enthusiast and nature explorer. Throughout my life, I have engaged in a variety of outdoor sports, including hiking, climbing, abseiling, surfing, scuba diving, free diving, caving, sailing, kayaking, and cycling. I hold an Advanced Open Water (AOW) Diver certification with over 60 dives and am also certified in dinghy sailing and sea kayaking.

- My academic journey has taken me to three different countries across the world, enriching my experiences and adventures. I completed my BS degree in China, where I traveled extensively across the country for hiking and mountaineering. During my PhD in Singapore, I explored neighboring countries in tropical Southeast Asia to see volcanoes, rain forests and underwater world. In the United States, I have enjoyed visiting national parks and immersing myself in the wilderness.
