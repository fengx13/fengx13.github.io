More about me:

- My name in Chinese is 谢丰, and I was raised in Guilin, a picturesque city in Southern China renowned for its stunning landscapes, famously described as “桂林山水甲天下” (East or west, Guilin scenery is best).

- My academic journey has taken me to three different countries across the world, enriching my experiences and adventures. I completed my BS degree in China, where I traveled across the country for hiking and mountaineering. During my PhD in Singapore, I explored neighboring countries in tropical Southeast Asia to see [volcanoes](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/volcano.jpg), [rain forests](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/rainforest.jpg), and the underwater world. This is my [favorite cycling route](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/bestcycle.jpg) and I was also a [marathon runner](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/singaporerun.jpg) in Singapore. In the United States, I have enjoyed visiting national parks and immersing myself in the wilderness.
- My favorite national park is [Wrangell-St. Elias National Park](https://www.nps.gov/wrst/index.htm) in Alaska, where I spent a night camping beside a glacier and did [glacier hiking](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/glacier.jpg) (real wilderness experience). I also really enjoy [Gates of the Arctic National Park](https://www.nps.gov/gaar/index.htm), one of the most remote places in the U.S. We drove along the [Dalton Highway](https://www.alaska.org/guide/dalton-highway), camped at [Galbraith Lake Campground](https://www.blm.gov/visit/galbraith-lake-campground), and was treated to a breathtaking display of the northern lights in the Premier Wilderness. My favorite trail is [Half Dome via the John Muir Trail](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm) in Yosemite National Park. I spent the whole day (13 hours+) completing this 16-mile round-trip hike, but the stunning scenery made it all worthwhile.
