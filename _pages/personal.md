More about me:

- My name in Chinese is 谢丰, and I was raised in Guilin, a picturesque city in Southern China renowned for its stunning landscapes, famously described as “桂林山水甲天下” (East or west, Guilin scenery is best).

- I am an outdoor enthusiast and nature explorer. Throughout my life, I have engaged in a variety of outdoor sports, including [hiking](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/hiking.jpg), [climbing](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/climb.jpg), [abseiling](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/abs.jpg), [surfing](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/surf.jpg), [scuba diving](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/diving.jpg), [free diving](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/freediving.jpg), [caving](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/caving.jpg), [sailing](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/sailing1.jpg), [kayaking](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/kayak2.jpg), and [cycling](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/cycling.jpg). I hold an Advanced Open Water (AOW) Diver certification with over 60 dives and am also certified in dinghy sailing and sea kayaking. The three best dive sites I have been to are the Similan Islands in Thailand, [Sipadan Island in Sabah, Malaysia](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/sipadan.jpg), and [Komodo National Park in Indonesia](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/komodo.jpg). The best caving experience I had was at Mulu National Park in Sarawak, Malaysia, where I completed the [4.8-kilometer Clearwater Connection trail](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1483707-d8471001-Reviews-Clearwater_Connection-Gunung_Mulu_National_Park_Sarawak.html), spending over [8 hours underground](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/caving.mp4). The journey involved climbing up and down muddy slopes, [squeezing](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/clearwater2.jpg) through tight passages, and repeatedly swimming across the [underground river](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/clearwater.jpg).

- My academic journey has taken me to three different countries across the world, enriching my experiences and adventures. I completed my BS degree in China, where I traveled extensively across the country for hiking and mountaineering. During my PhD in Singapore, I explored neighboring countries in tropical Southeast Asia to see [volcanoes](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/volcano.jpg), [rain forests](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/rainforest.jpg), and the underwater world. This is my [favorite cycling route](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/bestcycle.jpg) and I was also a [marathon runner](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/singaporerun.jpg) in Singapore. In the United States, I have enjoyed visiting national parks and immersing myself in the wilderness. My favorite national park is Wrangell-St. Elias National Park in Alaska, where I spent a night camping beside a glacier and did [glacier hiking](https://fengx13.github.io/images/more_images/glacier.jpg) (real wilderness experience). I also really enjoy [Haleakalā National Park in Hawaii](https://media.mybnbwebsite.com/11934/Haleakala_National_Park.jpg), where you can see amazing views of both sunset and sunrise. My favorite trail is [Half Dome via the John Muir Trail](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm) in Yosemite National Park. I spent the whole day (13 hours+) completing this 16-mile round-trip hike, but the stunning scenery made it all worthwhile.
