I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Division of Computational Health Science](https://med.umn.edu/surgery/divisions/computational-health-sciences) in Department of Surgery at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I completed my postdoctoral training at Stanford University School of Medicine, working with [Dr. Nima Aghaeepour](https://nalab.stanford.edu/team/nima-aghaeepour/). Before that, I earned my PhD in Integrated Biology and Medicine (Specialized in health data science research) from [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/) in 2022, where I worked with [Dr. Bibhas Chakraborty](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/), [Dr. Nan Liu](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/liunan/), [Dr. Marcus Ong](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/directory/detail/ong-eng-hock-marcus). I received my BS degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2017.

My research integrates expertise from medical informatics, biology, health services research, and biostatistics. I focus on developing innovative informatics methodologies and applying them across various healthcare domains. My work involved leveraging large-scale multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical signal data, to address significant healthcare challenges. I have also developed methodologies to enhance model interpretability, generalizability, and reproducibility, thereby fostering trustworthiness in machine learning applications within healthcare.
