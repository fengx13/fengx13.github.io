I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Division of Computational Health Science](https://med.umn.edu/bio/feng-xie) in the Department of Surgery and a Graduate Faculty of Data Science in the [College of Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience/feng-xie) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) School of Medicine, working with [Dr. Nima Aghaeepour](https://nalab.stanford.edu/team/nima-aghaeepour/). Before that, I earned my PhD in Integrated Biology and Medicine (specializing in health services and data science research) from [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/) in 2022, where I worked with [Dr. Bibhas Chakraborty](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/), [Dr. Nan Liu](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/liunan/), and [Dr. Marcus Ong](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/directory/detail/ong-eng-hock-marcus). I received my BS degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2017.

My research integrates expertise from medical informatics, biology, health services research, and biostatistics. I focus on developing innovative and trustworthy machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, and applying them across various healthcare domains. My work involved leveraging large-scale multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR), clinical notes, signals and multiomics data, to address significant healthcare challenges. I have also developed methodologies to enhance model interpretability, generalizability, and reproducibility, fostering trustworthiness in AI/ML applications within healthcare.
