I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Division of Computational Health Science](https://med.umn.edu/surgery/divisions/computational-health-sciences) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I completed my postdoctoral training at Stanford University School of Medicine, working with [Dr. Nima Aghaeepour](https://nalab.stanford.edu/team/nima-aghaeepour/). Before that, I earned my Ph.D. in integrated Biology and Medicine (Specialized in health data science research) from [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/) in 2022, where I worked with [Dr. Bibhas Chakraborty](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/), [Dr. Nan Liu](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/liunan/), [Dr. Marcus Ong](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/directory/detail/ong-eng-hock-marcus). I also received my B.S. from Tsinghua University in 2017.

I have multidisciplinary background in medical informatics, biology, health services research, and biostatistics. My research focuses on developing novel informatics methodologies and applying them to various healthcare domains. In my previous research, I extensively utilized large-scale multimodal data including electronic health records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical signal data, to address critical healthcare challenges. I also developed a series of methods to promote model interpretability, generalizability, and reproducibility, and promote the trustworthiness of machine learning model applications in healthcare.
