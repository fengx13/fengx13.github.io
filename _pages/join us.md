## üî¨ Research Focus  
Our lab specializes in **Health Data Science** and **Medical Informatics**, with research areas including:

- Mining and analyzing large-scale healthcare data  
- **Trustworthy machine learning (ML/AI)**: interpretability, fairness, and reproducibility  
- Integration of **multimodal data**, such as structured **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**, clinical narratives, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- Clinical deployment of AI models in high-stakes settings including **emergency care**, **critical care**, and **neonatology**  
  - Topics include **disease prediction**, **prognosis modeling**, **clinical decision support**, and **personalized treatment recommendations**

We aim not only to develop new methods, but also to produce **clinically impactful research**. Our work is guided by a clear goal: publication in **high-impact medical journals** such as *JAMA Network*, *The Lancet Digital Health*, and *npj Digital Medicine*, with the intention of **translating data science into real-world healthcare solutions**.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ About the PI and the Lab  
The lab is led by an **Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School**, with expertise in **medical AI, EHR modeling, and algorithmic fairness**. The PI has international experience from Singapore and Stanford, and has published in top-tier journals and developed widely adopted open-source tools.
